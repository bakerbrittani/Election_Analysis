### An Analysis of Election Results

## Purpose
  In this analysis our goal was to understand the results for each of the candidates. In addition to their results we also want a breakdown of the results by county so we can see what the voter turnout was for each county. We were specifically evaluating how each candidate performed, and who won the popular vote. We also wanted to know the voter turnout for each county and which county had the best turnout. The point of the ‘print’ was to visualize election results by candidate. When analyzing each individual candidates’ results we needed to answer how many and what percentage of votes that each candidate received, and ultimately which candidate was the winner.

## Results 
  Individual analysis of the candidates is as follows: Charles Casper Stockham obtained 85,213 votes for a total of 23.0% of the overall vote. Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes for a total of 3.1% of the overall vote. Diana DeGette won with 272, 892 votes for a whopping 73.8% of the overall vote.

  To further analyze the election results, we should evaluate by the county as well. 38,855 people voted in Jefferson County totaling 10.5% of the overall vote. 24,801 people voted in Arapahoe County, totaling 6.7% of the overall vote. In Denver 306,055 people voted for a total of 82.8% of the overall vote.

## Summary
  The script attached is an effective tool for election analysis and can be used for years. To replicate this analysis in the future we can easily replace the data in the CSV file and run the code. This method requires no changes to the code and will give you same analysis for different data points. The second option would be updating the path within the code to point to different files. The second option would be preferred since you could potentially compare multiple different results without deleting/losing data.
